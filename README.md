For Now a dummy model is created using VGG19 (Showing poor traing performance). VGG 19 is a convolutional neural network that is 19 layers deep. 
Actual Model is higly accurate (Under Publication) and can be discussed in personal (Email: fshakeel453@gmail.com)
The complete work will be added here after the completion of the Publication work:
